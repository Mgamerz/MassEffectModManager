Some of these were THE first mesh mods available for ME3.","mountpriority":3990,"dlcfoldername":"DLC_CON_Geto01"},"DLC_CON_GPGF01":{"modname":"GPG FemShep Hair Mod 001 Afro DLC","moddev":"ElysiumFic

A few Mod Manager mods can automatically change how they install based on what is already installed, so you should typically install them last. Texture mods, such as MEUITM or ALOT, must always be installed at the very end. Mod Manager will refuse to install mods that contain package files after texture mods have been installed to prevent invalid texture pointers from being introduced to the game.</helpitem><helpitem title=\"Can I get banned from ME3 MP for using mods\" modalicon=\"INFO\" modaltitle=\"Mods and Multiplayer\">BioWare has abandoned Mass Effect 3 (OT) since 2013, they do not ban or monitor anything related to Mass Effect 3 anymore. That said, if you are modding Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, you should keep it in private lobbies to be considerate to others.</helpitem></list><nonlocalizedhelpmenu name=\"changelogs\" title=\"Changelogs\"/></helpmenu><helpmenu lang=\"deu\"><helpitem title=\"ME3Tweaks Discord\" url=\"https://discord.gg/s8HA6dc\" tooltip=\"Chat Server für schnelle Unterstützung zu ME3Tweaks-Produkten und Diensten\"/><helpitem title=\"N7 Squad Multiplayer Discord\" url=\"https://discord.gg/n7squad\" tooltip=\"Chat Server, um andere Mass Effect 3 MP- und Mass Effect Andromeda MP-Spieler zu finden\"/><helpitem title=\"Public Modding Discord\" url=\"https://discord.gg/su8XjdUQPw\" tooltip=\"Server für allgemeines Mass Effect Modding\"/><helpitem title=\"Mgamerz' Twitter\" url=\"https://twitter.com/Mgamerz\" tooltip=\"Mgamerz' Twitter, lustige und interessante Modding-Einblicke (Englisch)\"/><list title=\"Mods beziehen\"><!--<helpitem title=\"ME3Tweaks ModMaker Gallery\" url=\"https://me3tweaks.com/modmaker/gallery\" tooltip=\"Browse mods developed on ME3Tweaks ModMaker\"/>--><helpitem title=\"Liste der von ME3Tweaks vorgeschlagenen Mods\" url=\"https://me3tweaks.com/mods\" tooltip=\"Stöbere durch von ME3Tweaks vorgeschlagene Mods\"/><helpitem title=\"NexusMods (ME1)\" url=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect/\" tooltip=\"Stöbere durch Mods für Mass Effect auf NexusMods\"/><helpitem title=\"NexusMods (ME2)\" url=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect2/\" tooltip=\"Stöbere durch Mods für Mass Effect 2 auf NexusMods\"/><helpitem title=\"NexusMods (ME3)\" url=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/\" tooltip=\"Stöbere durch Mods für Mass Effect 3 auf NexusMods\"/></list><list title=\"Kurzanleitung\"><helpitem title=\"Einen Mod hinzufügen\" modaltitle=\"Mod zu Mod Manager hinzufügen\" icon=\"INFO\">Um einen Mod zu Mod Manager hinzuzufügen, ziehe die .7z/.rar/.zip/.exe/.me2mod-Datei auf das Hauptfenster von Mod Manager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Um einen ModMaker-Mod herunterzuladen, gib seinen Code im Fenster Mod Management &gt; ModMaker Mod herunterladen ein.</helpitem><!--<helpitem title=\"Make a mod\" url=\"https://me3tweaks.com/modmanager/documentation/moddesc\"/>--><helpitem title=\"Einen Mod entfernen\" modaltitle=\"Einen Mod aus der Bibliothek entfernen\" modalicon=\"INFO\">Um einen Mod aus der Bibliothek zu entfernen (nicht aus dem Spiel), lösche seinen Ordner aus dem Mods/&lt;Spiel&gt; Ordner, oder wähle ihn aus, gehe ins Mod-Werkzeuge-Menü und klicke Mod aus Bibliothek löschen.</helpitem><helpitem title=\"Einen Mod installieren\" modaltitle=\"Einen Mod installieren\" modalicon=\"INFO\">Wähle links einen Mod und klicke auf Mod installieren, um ihn ins Spiel zu installieren.

Ein paar Mod Manager Mods können sich automatisch verändern, basierend darauf welche anderen Mods bereits installiert sind, daher solltest du diese normalerweise als letztes installieren. Textur-Mods, wie zum Beispiel MEUITM oder ALOT, müssen immer zum Schluss installiert werden. Mod Manager wird sich weigern, Mods die package-Dateien beinhalten zu installieren, nachdem Textur-Mods installiert wurden, um ungültige Texturzeiger zu verhindern.</helpitem><helpitem title=\"Kann ich wegen Mods vom ME3 MP gebannt werden\" modalicon=\"INFO\" modaltitle=\"Mods und Multiplayer\">BioWare hat Mass Effect 3 seit 2013 aufgegeben, nichts bezüglich Mass Effect 3 wird mehr gebannt oder überwacht.

Некоторые моды Mod Manager могут автоматически определить, как им устанавливаться, в зависимости от того, что уже установлено, поэтому обычно их лучше устанавливать в последнюю очередь. Текстурные моды, такие как MEUITM или ALOT, должны устанавливаться исключительно после всех остальных. Mod Manager откажется устанавливать моды, содержащие пакетные файлы, после того, как были установлены текстурные моды, чтобы избежать появления недопустимых указателей текстур в игре.</helpitem><helpitem title=\"Могут ли меня забанить в ME3 MP за использование модов\" modalicon=\"INFO\" modaltitle=\"Моды в Мультиплеере\">BioWare забросили Mass Effect 3 с 2013 года, они больше не следят и не банят ничего, что связано с Mass Effect 3.

Niektóre mody Mod Managera automatycznie zmieniają kolejność ładowania w oparciu o te wcześniej zainstalowane i one powinny być instalowane na końcu. Mody tekstur, takie jak MEUITM czy ALOT, muszą zawsze być instalowane jako ostatnie. Mod Manager odmówi instalacji modów zawierających pakiety plików jeżeli jakikolwiek mod zmieniający tekstury był już instalowany, aby zapobiec powstaniu problemów z grą.</helpitem><helpitem title=\"Czy mogę zostać zbanowany za używanie modów w ME3 w trybie Multiplayer?\" modalicon=\"INFO\" modaltitle=\"Mody i rozgrywka wieloosobowa\">BioWare porzuciło Mass Effect 3 w 2013 roku, od tego czasu nie banują ani nie monitorują rzeczy związanych z grą.

Mods de textura, como o MEUITM ou ALOT, devem sempre ser instalados depois de todos os outros.

Mod delle texture, come MEUITM o ALOT, devono sempre essere installate alla fine di tutto. Il Mod Manager si rifiuterà di installare mod che contengono file package dopo che sono state installate mod delle texture, per prevenire l'introduzione nel gioco di puntatori a texture non validi.</helpitem><helpitem title=\"Posso essere bannato dal Multiplayer di ME3 per l'utilizzo di mod?\" modalicon=\"INFO\" modaltitle=\"Mod e Multiplayer\">BioWare ha abbandonato Mass Effect 3 dal 2013, non bannano o monitorano più qualsiasi cosa che sia legata al gioco.
